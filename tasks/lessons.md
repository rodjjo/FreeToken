## 2026-08-26 (Ornith phase 2 live A/B)
- Never grade model output by grepping a raw SSE stream: tokens split codes
  across `data:` events. Concatenate the JSON `text` fields first. (Caused 3
  false NEEDLE_MISS on a run that was actually 3/3.)
- A "server startup timeout" on this stack is usually one of: (a) stale
  torch_extensions `lock` from a SIGKILLed build -- the loader sleep-polls it
  forever; (b) swap-cold expert-bank build. Diagnose via /proc/<pid>/wchan
  (hrtimer_nanosleep) + lock mtime BEFORE extending timeouts or killing.
- `pkill -f "ft serve"` does NOT kill the workers: they are
  `multiprocessing.spawn` stubs holding ~20 GiB shmem banks. Kill by venv path
  and verify with `free -g`, or the next run OOMs the box (took the terminal
  down 3x).
- `--num-tokens` is GPU KV capacity, not host RAM. Don't guess flag semantics
  in explanations to the user -- read the argparse help first.
- Structure live perf claims as env-gated A/B on the same box minutes apart
  (FREETOKEN_GGUF_DISABLE_MMA=1), with a path-proof mechanism decided BEFORE
  the run; in-server INFO logging is swallowed by the log handler, so proof
  must be external (JIT cache touch, wall-time signature).
